The objective is to bake 3 pastries below the "Order List" utilizing the buttons on the Poly Oven. Three buttons select either a Cookie, Ice-Cream, or Cake whilst the remaining buttons deal with increasing the Sweetness by 1, removing the selection, or baking the selected pastry. After 3 correct pastries are baked, a new order is generated.
